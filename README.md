# Data Science Projects

 This repository presents data science projects I carried out as a part of my MSc Data Science degree </br> </br>  The projects involve a modelling and implementing of comprehensive range of algorithms and methodologies on intriguing real-world data sets

</b> List of projects with brief explanation are as below. Relevant source codes can be found at each sub-directory.
